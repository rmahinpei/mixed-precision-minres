# Matrices
Note that we have **not** (yet) included the Maxwell and Stokes saddle-point systems used in the numerical experiments discussed in 
[this thesis](https://github.com/rmahinpei/mixed-precision-minres/blob/main/thesis_mahinpei.pdf) here.
To gain access to these saddle-point systems, feel free to reach out to [Dr. Chen Greif](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~greif/) who worked on the MATLAB source code responsible for generating these systems.

### [```test.mat```](https://github.com/rmahinpei/mixed-precision-minres/blob/main/matrices/test.mat)
An example saddle-point system to test the mixed precision MINRES implementations.
